# LEDsDimming
In this IoT project, LED dimming is simulated and tested for functionality. The code is compiled into a hex file. Optionally, a bootloader can be set up and programmed onto the hardware. The LED dimming code is then flashed to the hardware using a programmer or bootloader for verification.
